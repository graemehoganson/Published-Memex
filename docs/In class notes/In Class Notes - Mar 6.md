Digital, Electronic Computers: Competences and Social Necessities

A machine that thinks vs mind body reality

[Alan Turing] - 'on Compitable Numbers, with an application to the *Entscheidungsproblem*

1931 - Kurt Godel ( you cant open a box with the crowbar inside it) 

The Turing Machine - is there a series of tests that can be done to determine when a problem cannot be completed?
- creates a general purpose computer (if you can word the problem correctly the computer can essentially solve any problem)

Combining Shannons information theory (bits) wit Turings computer and you have a way for a machine computer to simulate any of the work a human computer could do

With the development of the modern computer came a wave of pop culture symbols of elecronic brains ( in a similar way that pop culture features clockwork people during that era of development)

- Parallel kinds of computing devices - the analogue simulators
- kelvin's tide calculator for different points around the world
- Kelvin proposes in 1876 a way of linking several similar devices together physically to simulate differential equations
- The mechanisms to achieve this not developed until the 1920s... and Vannevar Bush

'programming' these machines:
- literally bashing them into different shapes with hammers and wrenches.
- useful for scientific analysis


George Stibits (bell labs) - 1937
- builds the first complexe calculator (model 1)
- does a demo of the model one via telephone wire (first time a computing device was used via telephone wire)

Konrad Zuse - 1936 (German)
- Creates the S1 and Z3
- programmable

Howard Aitken
- prof at Harvard, Had designed his own electro-mechanical calculator to help with his thesis work: proposes the machine to the military in 1937; military says nah, though its own reviewing engineer wanted it: engineer introduces Aitken to IBM and Thomas Watson (president)
- in the navy Aiken meets Grace Hopper

Existing 'social necessity' good enough for electro-mechanical calculators

Mauchly and ENIAC 6
- electronic Numerical integrator and calculator/computer
- this program ignored something quite critical
	- Who did the programming? (women)
	- How long did it take to set the program up?
Grace Hopper
- math prof at Vacer
- enlists and joins the navy
- navy sends her to work for Aiken
- as the war dies down Hopper goes to work with the ENIAC where they eventually create thier own company 

We are in a period of digital incunabula - the missing supervening social necessity? Nuclear War

Newman brought one of the necessary equations for the Nuclear bombs detonation to the ENIAC for them to solve
