**Summary**

In their book, Daniel R. Headrick and Pascal Griset write about the history of submarine [[telegraph]] cables. They talk about the development of the technology and the work of various entrepeneurs and governments to lay the cables accross the oceans ([[Samuel Morse]], British, French and German Governments, and more). The main goal behind laying the cables was due to economic and political motivations (trade and military comunications) as well as competition between nation to establish telegraph supremacy.
