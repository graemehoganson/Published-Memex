Computational Incunabula: The British Experience 

Colossus
- developped during WW2
- emerges from the Bombe
- Never fully declassified until well after the war
- supervening necessity: German Wolfpack

Enigma Machine
- based on rotor encryption device made in america
- Arthur Sherbius 
- Substitution cypher

Polish computers and coders created a machine called the Bombe to decrypt the encryptions made by the Enigma, however,, if the Enigma was given another rotor, The Bombe becomes useless and another one must be made. 

Hut and Bletchly park

Bombe to Colossus
- Turing's teacher, Max Newman, leads design of Collosus
- Collosus could suggest best match for a pattern within a text
- second colussus could figure out whih pattern was best to try
- integrating valves the key

Post war developments Doldrums
- multiple teams are exploring these machines that sit on the calculator/ computer barrier
- von Neuman writes the first draft of a report on the EDVAC 1945
- but for the most part, the urgency is gone, everyone losing steam. in terms of computing design
- last technical hurdle to solve is the problem of memory

From one supervening necessity to another
- project whirlwind
	- starts off as a a kind of analogue computer meant to simulate flight on multiple kinds of airplanes being developped during the war
	- most expensive of the various computing projects: navy loses interest.
	- Airforce takes over: the only machine that could plot intercept cources for strategic long range bombers
	- solves the problem of magnetic memory

Joe Thompson - one of the first african american coders

Back in Britain
- Manchester Baby
- Built to test another solution to the problem of memory
- runs a stored program from ememry in 1948 - another 'first computer' moment

allies no longer sharing information
- act of congress in 1946 closes off data sharing with allies over nuclear work
- Britain sets out to build its own expertise
- decides that all such experiments ought to be centralised ot the national physical laboratory 
- the official british computer will be built at NPL and they turn to Turing to make it the ' Automatic Computing Engine'

The death of Alan Turing
- Turing moves to Manchester to work on computing 1948
- His house is burgled: he calls the police. in the course of their investigation. Turing is forced to admit he's gay. 1952
- He was found guilty of gross indecency; imprisonment or probation with chemical castration
- loses security clearances. Chooses castration
- commits suicide 1954
- pardoned 2012

The period of the digital incunabula is over
-  in the uk commercial cersions of the machesyer baby are being sold by the ferranti corporation as general pupose business computers by 1951
- by 1952, IAS machine comes online
- The digital age begins

IBM finally gets in on the at
- incidentally, on some accounts. this is when the digital humanities are born - BUSA

Programming still an issue
- every computer has its own wriring, circuits, designs, idiosyncracies
- people like grace hopper are building compilers and higher level languages to ease programming and provide some interoperability
- mostly male programmers liked the secrecy of the way things were

Upshot
- every machine is unique
- every machine is ever larger, more expensive
- living on the government dime: both the funder and the buyer for these devices largely
