**Summary**
In pages 45-54 of Shiv's journal article. he begins  by talking about the early forms of library management and how people used to write and log books on clay tablets back in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt. These first libraries were used to log religious texts, law, among other subjects. He then moved forward in time to talk about Greece and Rome, where the establishment of public libraries was made and thus new works of literature began  to be made. He then makes another jump in time and discusses the role of libraries in the MIddle Ages, which saw the beginning of libraries becoming places to store information that people beleive should be preserved. He then moves into the modern era which discusses the establishment of nation based librarys in places like Europe and the states. Including the development of technology in library systems which helped to  jumpstart the digital age of library logging.
