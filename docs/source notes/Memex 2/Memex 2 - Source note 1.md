**Summary**

In the article Edwards details his experience in running a [BBS] (Bulletin Board System) in his childhood in the 1980's. He describes how he became a System Operator for his own BBS which he named "The Cave" at the age of 11 which effectively allowed him to connect with the other local computer enthusiasts. He credits one of these people, David Cothran alias "Bc" with being his mentor in teaching him how to create his own BBS effectively. Throughout the article he argues that despite their lack of mainstream popularity and nicheness BBS laid the groundwork for modern online communities and social media platforms.
