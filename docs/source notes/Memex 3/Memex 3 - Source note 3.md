**Summary**
Anatomy of an AI system is a paper written by Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler. It details the social and environemental issues that surround Amazon's home system AI the Amazon Echo. The main environmetntal issue they propose is that the whole system from start to finish creates environmental harm. From the mining process in extracting the rare minerals required for its creation, the carbon emission that go along with that as well as the manufacturing process, and finally the waste from disposing of the Echo which  can result in more environmental harm if not done properly. 

They also delve into the data infrastructure that underlies in the Amazon Echo. The Amazon Echo is a voice activated assistant, meaning that the device is always listening whereever it is placed in the home. Furthermore, with the artificial intelligence installed in the machine, the machine learns the behaviour of the people around it. Crawford and Joler talk about the ways in which the Echo is embedded into the larger system of social and  environmental reltaionships and how the device does not stand on its own, but rather fits into a network of actors and processors that has implications for both Chinese labour conditions for where the factories are situated and energy consumption for whatever home they are found in.
