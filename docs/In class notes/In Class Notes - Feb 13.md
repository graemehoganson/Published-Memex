**The First Internet: The telegraph**

Bryan Winston: historian 
- supervening social necessity
- a technology doesnt work without a broader social importance (a role for it to fill)

- in the example of Alexander Graham Bell, everyone knows he invented the telephone, however, people were also creating the telephone at the same time as the telephone was something that was needed in the social sphere. So although he is credited with the invention it was actually the social sphere that infleunced the creation

**The social sphere and the telegraph
- to infleunce the creation of the telegraph there needed to be 
1. a country big enough that telegraphed messages was more viable than just hand carrying letters
2. the industrial capability to make and implement the telegraph

- Ralph Wedgewood - somes up with scheme 1814; admiralty says no
- Francis Ronals - comes up with schene 1816; admiralty says no

- The admiralty said no to the telegraph initially because there was no  underlying social need for it. Armies had flags to communicate, everyone ekse had letters.
		- people knew how to systems worked and there was no need for the telegraph to exist

- what changed this was the invetnion of the galvameter 
	- in 1838 Edward Davy/William Cooke and Charles Whitestone invent a telegraph so that trains can communicate with each other to not crash
	- The social need for it happens as, if the trains can comunicate with each other,  there can be more trains on the track and thus more passengers/cargo and thus more money for the state and the rail companies

**An observation
- the telegraphs that were used on the trains does not feature certain characters (q,k and some others)
- this was done to reduce redundancy you could write words in short form (back --> bac) 
- This relates to the common modern short form abbreviations that can eb found in text messaging

**Morse**
- Attended Yale
- attempts to solve the problem of constant current/power 
- he takes the ideas of Faraday and many others to make his own telegraph
- realizes that the key to keeping signals effiecient is code, he observes print shops and find the frequency of letters of moveable type
- based off of his findings he makes his code so that the most c ommon letters are the simplest to make 
- The first message on Morse's telegraph was sent in 1844 (what hath God wrough?) sent from Baltimore to Wasbington 
- the reason it was sent to washington is becuase the American governemetn realed that they had very broad coasts and like the military they should be able to communicate with each cost effectively to defend it.
- Morse sent the first message hrough telegraph wires that were strung accross trees and buildings all the way form the train station in Balitimore to the supreme court in Washington
