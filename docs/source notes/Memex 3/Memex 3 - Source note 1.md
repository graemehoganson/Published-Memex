**Summary**
In her essay Simone M Muller ralks about the importance of the transatlantic [[telegraph]] cable laid down in 1866. She reflects of the technological political and cultural challenges and importance that this milestone had on the world.  

One of the main technological difficulties that Muller discusses is the problem of maintaining a signal over such a large distance. SIgnals that travelled through the cable would [[attenuate]] meaning that engineers needed to incorporate a way to boost the signal along its path in order to maintain a strong connection. 

Another thing Muller touches on is the impact that the cable had on global communication and its cultural significance to the world. What the cables did was connect the world in a way that had never been done before. Before the cable was laid, communication between the americas and europe would take weeks or months. With the transatlantic telegraph cable communication could be accomplished almost instantaniously. This shift changed peoples perspective about the world and made people think of it as a smaller more interconneced place.
