**How business shennanigans gives rise to information theory**

By the end of the 19th century, 'networks' were not a novel idea
- networks were already a prominent structure in modern society (sewers, letters, etc...)
- when Graham Bell orgiinally sold his telephones they were sold exclusively in pairs, he did not believe that these pairs of telephones would eventually connnect and network through the central hubs (operators), which then made the Bell company switch their business model.

[[The Stowger automatic exchange]] - 1892
- invented by an undertaker due to lack of business which would automatically connect those attempting to call him rather than routing through the operator who was supposedly married to a rival undertaker. 
- 1919 - the Bell company starts using the automatic exchange

- the first two decades of telephony - very slow uptake 
- subject to interference from other electrical sources - trolleys, [[telegraph]] wires, thunderstorms

- First Bell comany founded in 1875
- First telephone exchange operated by Western Union's telephone subsidery
- First woman central office opertaor: 1878, Emma Nutt
- Idea of assigning unique numbers to subscribers suggested in 1879

National Bell becomes American bell
upshot:
- Hubbard and Bell are out
- Theodore Vail becomes the head of the Bell comapny
- The agreement with Western Union still in force

Copyright in the 1900s was around 10 years, the 10 years is almost up

Which breaks the agreement
- 1884 American Bell establishes long distance line between NY and Boston
- Creates a subsidiary company to do this: American Telephone and Telephone Company (AT and T)
- establishes a laboratory to improve long distance telephony
- 1888 - all the court battles aroud the original patents are won by Bell
- Bell is making money out 
- independants appear; Bell fights them with both legitiamte and spurious court cases
- cuts rates ridiculously where there is competion
- feuses to interconnect to other systems
- buys up stocks of competitors

- The invention of the electric fence led to party lines as all you needed to do was insulate one of the wires and then you have a ready made telepphone lines 

- Long distance telephpny was central to Bell's plan to survive the expiration of its patents
- seemed also that Bell was directing customers to use telegraph services that it owned/had major stake in
- antitrust legislation, populist politicians, intertstate commerce commisiions

- Bell labs becomes an incredibly prominent research facility at bell labs.
- By WW2 Bell is worth 5 billion dollars

Claude Shannon
- Grad student at MIT
- Student of Vannivar Bush who is working on analog computers and missile control systems
- As a MA student he pretty much lays out the foundations for modern digital technology

-  Claude Shannon shows us that electrical circuits can perform logical operations
-  Which opens the door 
- At Bell labs Shannon comes up with Information theory 
- Information theory -  the information of a message is independant of the message system (midi all star example)
- in 1948 he took the idea of logical conclusion and developed a way to think about a message as being composed of two things 
	- the content 
	- the information
- the informtion is a measuremetn of the redundancy of that content 

- Redundancy is the key to understanding language (its also the reason why modern laguage models like GPT3 work)

- combine information theory - the division of the message form its meaning - with logical circuits and you get the 20th century
