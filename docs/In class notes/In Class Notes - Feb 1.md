**Electric history
- [[electricity]] can be found everywhere in the wild 
Animals like 
- electric catfish and eels
- muchrooms 
- natural magnets

up until the 18th century [[electricity]] was nothing more than a curiosity, these naturally electric things aswell as static electiricity was all there was.

In the 18th century [Galvani] did experiments on frogs prodding parts of the frog until he discoverd that when touching certain parts the legs would move, thus concluding that there must be some kind of animal electricity

A law gets passed that someone who has no home, family, possesions etc in the event that they die, their body will be donated to be dissected. Especially if the individual is a murderer

Back in ancient Greece static [[electricity]] was discovered through fubbing amber with wool until is begins to attract (the wrod fro amber in Greek in Elektron hence the name)
- Things become "electric" as it was thought it had the properties of amber

The first attempt at storing this newfound electricity results in the ceration of a capacitor
- called a [[leyden jar]]
Jean Antoin (1746) -  attempts to find out how fast electricty actually moves
- gave 200 monks a meter long brass rod, resulting in a mile long circle of munks
- Antoin then shocks one of the bars with a layden jar and attempts to see how long it takes for all the monks to get shocked

Electricity and magnets
[Hans Christian Orsted] - works out that electric current in a nearby wire will deflect a compass needle; he works out that electric current produces a circular magnetic field

[Micheal faraday] - works out how to go to the other way, that you could use a magnet to induce electricity.

[Joseph henry] - inventor of many electrical devices, including the relay

[Telegraphs]
- you cant just string up a wire from a to b
- gotta think in circuits and take into account how to make that juice flow
- Once Henry-and others- solved that messages at a distance are now feasible
- just in time too:first steam powered railways open in the 1830s
