**Summary**
In his article Phillip L. Frana  talks about a precursor to the modern internet called the [[Gopher protocol]]. 

He describes the use of the internet in the 90s. It was a tool mainly used by researchers, however, With the introduction of Gopher "non-experts" were able to experience the internet. Frana talks about the features that the Gopher protocol had, those being a hierarchical menu of resources and the simple text based interface that would inspire the modern internet tool of [[hyperlinks]]. 

In the end, Frana talks about how Gopher was quickly replaced with the modern WWW as it was just in general a vastly improved internet medium.
